A beautifully simple, perfectly centered, and accessible **Random Decimal Hex Binary and String Generator** that produces unique, non-repeating outputs in multiple formats ‚Äî decimal numbers, hexadecimal, binary, and alphanumeric strings. Every result is guaranteed unique per mode and length on each device. The app features smooth animations, OCD-satisfying CSS, full accessibility, and persistent history between sessions.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Supported Modes:**  
  - Decimal numbers (any digit length, up to 1000)  
  - Hexadecimal (A‚ÄìF, 0‚Äì9, up to 1000 characters)  
  - Binary (0/1, up to 1000 characters)  
  - Alphanumeric strings (A‚ÄìZ, a-z, 0-9, up to 1000 characters)  

- **Preset Lengths:**  
  Quick-select buttons for lengths 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 ‚Äî all rounded to multiples of 5.

- **Perfectly Centered Modern Layout:**  
  Built with Tailwind CSS grid and flexbox for complete visual and vertical centering on any screen or device.

- **Output Box & Fixed Font:**  
  - Large, bold output text that never shrinks or scrolls‚Äîalways clearly readable, even at maximum length.  
  - Output text wraps nicely without overflow or scrollbars.

- **Fixed Max Length:**  
  Max length is fixed at **1000**, enforced everywhere for consistent behavior.

- **Non-Repeating Unique Outputs:**  
  - Every generated output is checked against a persistent history stored in device `localStorage`.  
  - The same output will never be generated twice for the same mode and length unless storage is cleared.  
  - If all possible outputs are exhausted for a given mode and length, a clear "All numbers used!" message is displayed.

- **Preset & Length Controls:**  
  - Preset buttons enforce multiples of 5.  
  - Slider and numeric input are kept in sync and remember user settings via `localStorage`.

- **Accessible, Large Interaction Buttons:**  
  - **Roll:** Large button with dice icon, includes pop animation and a temporary full-screen "Rolled!" overlay.  
  - **Copy:** Large button with copy icon, triggers clipboard copy with an animated full-screen "Copied!" overlay.  
  - Buttons are keyboard accessible, focusable, and touch-friendly.

- **Keyboard & Touch Accessibility:**  
  Tab-navigable controls with visible focus outlines and proper ARIA roles.

- **Smooth GSAP-Powered Animations:**  
  - Output bounces and changes color on roll.  
  - Roll and Copy buttons animate when clicked.  
  - Full-screen overlays visually confirm actions.

- **Footer Credit:**  
  Displays ‚ÄúMade with ‚ù§Ô∏è by Harsh Trivedi‚Äù with a FontAwesome heart icon, always centered at the bottom.

- **OCD-Perfect CSS:**  
  Dimensions, spacing, and typography use values rounded to multiples of 5 for uniformity and elegance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5 & CSS3** with Poppins font and FontAwesome icons  
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and responsiveness via CDN  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** for logic, generation, and UI control  
- **GSAP (GreenSock)** for advanced animations and overlays  
- **localStorage & Cookies:**  
  - `localStorage` tracks generated outputs and remembers user settings  
  - Cookies store user preferences like last selected mode and auto-copy toggle

## üîí Accessibility & UX

- All controls have descriptive ARIA attributes and visible, pronounced focus states  
- High contrast black & white color scheme for readability  
- Responsive and adaptive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices  
- Output and overlays announce changes via `aria-live` regions  
- No scrollbars or clipped content during normal operation  
- Clear, user-friendly messages when output space is exhausted

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing

- **Preset Lengths:**  
  Edit the preset values inside the `setPresets()` function in `app.js`. Ensure they remain multiples of 5 for UI consistency.  
- **Max Length:**  
  By default fixed at 1000; increase by adjusting the max values in HTML and JS accordingly.  
- **Appearance & Fonts:**  
  Modify styling in `style.css`, especially `.unboxed-output` for font size and padding.  
- **Animations:**  
  Adjust or replace GSAP animations in the JS file for custom effects or disable GSAP if desired (app still fully functional).  
- **Auto-Copy Feature:**  
  Toggle on/off is user-controllable via checkbox; state saved in cookies.

## How Non-Repeating Output Works

- Generated outputs are recorded by mode and length in browser `localStorage`.  
- Prior to displaying, the app checks this history and regenerates until a unique output is found or maximum attempts reached.  
- If all outputs are exhausted, the app displays "All numbers used!".  
- Users can clear browser storage to reset history and start fresh.

## Why This Project?

- For users who want a dependable, multi-format random generator with guaranteed uniqueness per session and device.  
- To provide a clean, accessible, and visually balanced tool that‚Äôs equally great on phones, tablets, and desktops.  
- For those who desire elegant, OCD-approved spacing and sizing in design.  
- To offer frictionless offline use with no external dependencies beyond CDN scripts.
